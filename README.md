# Sanskrit-Document-RAG-Model
“I built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically for Sanskrit documents. The system allows users to ask questions in Sanskrit or transliterated text and get accurate responses based on the uploaded Sanskrit corpus. The entire pipeline works fully on CPU without any GPU dependency.”
